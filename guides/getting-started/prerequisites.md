# Prerequisites

## Installation

Before getting started with Celaris you need to have C++ installed on your system. How you do this will vary depending on your operating system. 

### Configuring Windows 

#### 1. Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools

To begin, you'll need to install the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ build tools. The simplest approach is to download and install the Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022. When choosing workloads, make sure to select both "C++ build tools" and the Windows 10 SDK.

#### 2. WebView2

::: info
On Windows 10 (version 1803 and later with all updates applied) and Windows 11, the WebView2 runtime is included with the operating system.
:::

Celaris relies heavily on WebView2 for rendering web content on Windows, so itâ€™s essential to have WebView2 installed. The simplest way to do this is by downloading and running the Evergreen Bootstrapper from [Microsoft's website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section).

The bootstrapper will automatically detect the appropriate architecture and version for your system. However, if you encounter issues (particularly with Windows on ARM), you can manually choose the correct standalone installer.


These commands will display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, verifying that everything is configured correctly.

### Configuring MacOS 

::: info
Coming soon
:::


### Configuring Linux

There are several development dependencies required for developing, building and releasing Celaris projects. For example, a C++ compiler, CMake (for C++) and webkit2gtk for the webview engine. These dependencies will be installed in different ways depending on your linux distribution.

:::tabs
== Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    file \
    libssl-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
    librsvg2-dev \
    cmake
```

== Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S --needed \
    webkit2gtk \
    base-devel \
    curl \
    wget \
    file \
    openssl \
    appmenu-gtk-module \
    gtk3 \
    libappindicator-gtk3 \
    librsvg \
    libvips \
    cmake
```

== Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf check-update
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.0-devel \
    openssl-devel \
    curl \
    wget \
    file \
    libappindicator-gtk3-devel \
    librsvg2-devel \
    cmake
sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries"
```

::: info
If you use a distribution not mentioned here, please submit specific instructions for how you would install the above packages on your distribution as an [issue on github](https://github.com/celaris-apps/docs/issues)
:::



### NodeJs

::: info
Node.js is required for building Celaris applications, as it manages the JavaScript dependencies.
:::

To install Node.js, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest stable version (LTS) suitable for your system. During installation, ensure that the Node.js runtime and npm (Node Package Manager) are included.

After installation, confirm Node.js is properly set up by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

::: warning
On linux (possibly macOS) if you use `sudo apt install npm` you will likely get an older version of node installed. It is recommended to install following the instructions in the link above!.

If you have already used this command, run the following command to undo this:

```bash
sudo apt remove npm -y && sudo apt remove nodejs -y
```

and check the packages are removed: 

```bash 
node -v
npm -v
```
