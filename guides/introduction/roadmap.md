# Roadmap

As detailed throughout the documentation, Celaris is still in its early stages of development. The following roadmap outlines the key features and improvements planned for future releases:

- **Build System:** Implement a build system to package applications for distribution on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Improved Communication:** Enhance the messaging system for more efficient communication between the backend and frontend.
- **Documentation:** Expand the documentation with more detailed guides, tutorials, and examples.
- **Community Contributions:** Encourage community contributions to improve Celaris and expand its capabilities.

::: warning NOTE

I never anticipated Celaris to become a full-fledged framework. It was initially created as a learning exercise to understand how Tauri works. However, the project has gained some traction, and I hope that one day it will become a viable alternative to existing frameworks.

However, development of Celaris will not be able to continue without community support and contributions. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](/guides/contributing/contributing-to-celaris).
