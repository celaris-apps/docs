Celaris is inspired by the popular framework [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), Celaris leverages the performance and control of native C++ applications while providing the flexibility and rapid development of modern web technologies. It allows developers to build cross-platform applications with a native backend and a modern frontend, enabling seamless communication between the two. 

> If you do not know what Tauri is, Tauri is a popular framework that allows developers to build cross-platform applications with a native backend and a modern frontend. It is strongly encouraged to check out Tauri first before diving into Celaris. I would recommend checking out the [Tauri Documentation](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/intro) to get a better understanding of how Tauri works. I would consider using Celaris if you already know why you would want to use it over Tauri.

::: tip DISCLAIMER
Celaris was initially born out of the curios desire to understand how Tauri works. Tauri is a popular framework that allows developers to build cross-platform applications with a native backend and a modern frontend. However, the desire to understand how Tauri works led to the creation of Celaris. I was undertaking CPD in C++ and I thought it would be a good way to learn how Tauri works by building a similar framework, but with a different approach.

::: warning WARNING

Celaris is still in its early stages of development and is not yet ready for production use. The framework is being actively developed and improved, and contributions are welcome.
