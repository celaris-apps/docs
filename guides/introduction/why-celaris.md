# Why Celaris?

The `Why Celaris?` question can be answered in 2 ways:

1. [Why was Celaris created?](#_1-why-was-celaris-created)
2. [Why should you use Celaris?](#_2-why-should-you-use-celaris)

## 1. Why was Celaris created?

Celaris was created to address the limitations of existing frameworks and provide a solution that combines the best of both worlds: native performance and modern web technologies. Here are some reasons why Celaris was developed:

- **Performance:** Celaris leverages C++ for backend processes, enabling high performance and low resource consumption.
- **Flexibility:** Developers can choose from popular frontend frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte to build rich user interfaces.
- **Communication:** Celaris establishes efficient communication between the C++ backend and the frontend through message passing.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Applications built with Celaris can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Celaris simplifies development with tools like `create-celaris` and `celaris-cli` for scaffolding and managing projects.


## 2. Why should you use Celaris?

Celaris currently does not, and may never, aim to replace Tauri. Tauri is a mature and feature-rich framework that is developed by, and has been used by, many developers to build cross-platform applications. Celaris, on the other hand, is a new framework that offers a different approach to building applications. Here are some reasons why you might consider using Celaris:

- **Exisiting Knowledge:** If you are already familiar with C++ and modern web technologies, Celaris provides a way to leverage your existing knowledge to build cross-platform applications.
- **Existing Projects:** If you have an existing C++ project and want to add a modern frontend to it, Celaris can help you achieve that.
- **Barebones Approach:** Celaris is not as feature-rich as Tauri, which can be an advantage if you prefer a more lightweight and customizable framework.



## Why not Celaris?

::: warning NOTE
While asking why you should use Celaris is important, it is equally important to consider why you might not want to use Celaris. Celaris has its advantages, but it may not be the best choice for every project. 
:::
Here are some reasons why you might not want to use Celaris:

- **Maturity:** Celaris is still in its early stages of development and may not have all the features you need for your project.
- **Community Support:** Tauri has a larger community and more resources available compared to Celaris.
- **Feature Parity:** Tauri has more features and is more mature compared to Celaris.
- **Learning Curve:** If you are new to C++ or modern web technologies, Celaris may not be the best choice for your first project.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Celaris is a new and promising framework that offers a different approach to building cross-platform applications. While it may not be suitable for every project, it provides a lightweight and flexible alternative to existing frameworks. If you are already familiar with C++ and modern web technologies, Celaris may be worth considering for your next project.
