# Who is Celaris for?

Given the lack of maturity and feature parity with other frameworks, Celaris is not for everyone. However, Celaris may be a good fit for you if you fall into one of the following categories:

## Seasoned Developers

If you are a seasoned developer who can develop without comprehensive documentation or community support, Celaris may be a good fit for you. Celaris is still in its early stages of development and may not have all the features you need for your project. However, if you are comfortable exploring and experimenting with new frameworks, Celaris can provide a lightweight and flexible alternative to existing frameworks.

## C++ Developers Looking for a Modern Frontend

If you are a C++ developer looking to build a modern frontend for your application, Celaris provides a way to leverage your existing C++ knowledge while incorporating a modern web interface. This allows you to build cross-platform applications with a native backend and a modern frontend.

## Developers with Existing C++ Projects

If you have an existing C++ project and want to add a modern frontend to it, Celaris can help you achieve that. Celaris allows you to build cross-platform applications with a native backend and a modern frontend, enabling seamless communication between the two.
